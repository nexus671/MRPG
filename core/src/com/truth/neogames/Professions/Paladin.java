 * Paladins serve as beacons for their allies within the chaos of battle. While deadly opponents of evil, they can also empower goodly souls to
 * aid in their crusades. Their magic and martial skills also make them well suited to defending others and blessing the fallen
 * with the strength to continue fighting.
