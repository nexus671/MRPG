 * Rogue
 * Rogues excel at moving about unseen and catching foes unaware, and tend to avoid head-to-head combat. Their varied skills and abilities
 * allow them to be highly versatile, with great variations in expertise existing between different rogues. Most, however, excel in overcoming hindrances
 * of all types, from unlocking doors and disarming traps to outwitting magical hazards and conning dull-witted opponents.
