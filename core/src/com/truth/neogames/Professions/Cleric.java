 * * Cleric
 * More than capable of upholding the honor of their deities in battle, clerics often prove stalwart and capable combatants. Their true strength
 * lies in their capability to draw upon the power of their deities, whether to increase their own and their allies' prowess in battle, to vex
 * their foes with divine magic, or to lend healing to companions in need.
